# Kajol
Date fruit classifier utilizing images obtained through computer vision 
to train machine learning algorithms such as Artificial Neural Networks and Decision trees.
This Python program implements PyTorch and TensorFlow for advanced computations and modeling.
The result of the Kajol program will classify dates into categories desirable for the cosmetic industry and even medicinal purpose!
All dates are food, but 7 categories have additional uses!
